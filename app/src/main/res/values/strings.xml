    <string name="about_us_text">The SmartVanity team consists of six electrical and computer engineering seniors who have an avid interest in making attractive solutions that enrich the lives of consumers. When presented with the opportunity to make anything we wanted, we asked what would make our lives, or the lives of those close to us, better. After watching our sisterâ€™s put their makeup on while hunched over a small phone screen, trying to hear our music over the sound of the shower, or walking outside only to turn back around to grab a jacket or umbrella, we saw the opportunity for a solution that met all of these needs: the SmartVanity Mirror.
In the room that everyone starts their day, there is now a single solution which helps you start your day on the right foot. Capable of showing your daily schedule, the weather, or even sports scores, the SmartVanity mirror allows the user to customize the mirror to fit their needs. Furthermore, the user can push hairstyle and makeup tutorials to the mirror so that they no longer have to watch the video leaned over a small screen. The SmartVanity team has aimed to ensure that the mirror helps everyone walk out the door prepared for the day and looking their best.
